[![Docs.rs](https://docs.rs/where39/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/where39/)

[Where39](https://github.com/arcbtc/where39) ist a standard to encode geo locations using 
[BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) seed words. This
repository contains an implementation in rust that tries to mirror the behavior of the original JS
library since there doesn't exist any formal specification yet.

You can play around with the algorithm at [where39.com](https://where39.com/).
